Question 1 :
 ## What is Blockchain ##
Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.
Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, 
a record of that transaction is added to every participantâ€™s ledger.
The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

Question 2 :
## Core Problem Blockchain trying to solve ##
1. Blockchain Addresses The Problem Of Data Loss Due To Hardware Or Connectivity Issues
2. Blockchain Addresses The Problem Of Data Corruption Due To Intermittent Hardware Or Connectivity Issues
3. Blockchain Addresses The Problem Of Data Security And Trust By Making The Ledger Public

Question 3 :
## Features of Blockchain ##
1. Blockchain Addresses The Problem Of Data Security And Trust By Making The Ledger Public
2. Decentralized Technology
3. Enhanced Security
4. Distributed Ledgers

Question 4 :
## What things a block contain ##
A block represents the 'present' and contains information about its past and future.
Each time a block is completed it becomes part of the past and gives way to a new block in the blockchain. 
The completed block is a permanent record of transactions in the past and the new transactions are recorded in the current one.

##Question 5 :
##Verifiability of Blockchain ##
Validated transactions are stored into a block and are sealt with a lock (hash).
This block becomes part of the blockchain when other computers in the network validate if the lock on the block is correct.
Now the transaction is part of the blockchain and can not be altered in any way.
